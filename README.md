Title: Harmonising MIMIC and secondary cancer datasets: Evaluating Utility and Overcoming Challenges with Machine Learning Approaches.

Description: 
    This project has two main objectives:

        1. Data Harmonization: Combining the MIMIC-III database with a private immunology dataset.
        2. Machine Learning for Cancer Prediction: Utilizing machine learning models to predict cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

    At the project's conclusion, we aim to:
        - Develop a pipeline that merges the two datasets.
        - Evaluate whether using the combined dataset improves efficiency compared to using the individual datasets separately.
